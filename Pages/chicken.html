        <h2>How to make:</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Make the sweet and sour sauce: </strong>It consists of sugar, apple cider vinegar, ketchup, soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, garlic, corn starch, and water. Add everything but the water and cornstarch to a saucepan.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Bring the sauce to a boil, </strong>then combine the water and cornstarch in a seperate bowl before adding it to a homemade sweet and sour sauce.</p>
        <p><strong>3. </strong>Let that bubble away for a few minutes until it thickens up</p>
        <p><strong>4. Make the chicken: </strong>Add the diced chicken into a baggie until the cornstarch, salt, and pepper and give it a good shake to coat the chicken pieces fully</p>
        <p><strong>5. </strong>Fry the chicken in a skillet with a few tablespoons of olive oil (no need to deep fry).</p>
        <p><strong>6. </strong>Once the chicken is cooked, stir in the sweet and sour sauce and continue cooking until the chicken is coated in sauce and heated through</p>
        <p><strong>7. </strong>Serve and enjoy!</p>
